### What We Did
## Overview:
Welcome to the ChromaLux experiment! We developed an experiment and application to observe the correlation between lighting in virtual environments and subject emotion and performance. Development was conducted in Unity using OpenXR tools and an assortment of public assets, and subject testing took place at both CSU and the Denver suburbs. Our team is composed of Caleb Stewart, Benjamin Perry, and Kylee Hurley.

# Struggles
- Team Communication: Towards the end, team members struggled to communicate effectively and many revisions were needed in our final paper.
- VR Integration: Having never implemented VR into a Unity project before, it was difficult to add user interaction within a VR environment.
- Environment Optimization: Our "Forest" scene initially had severe performance issues, but this was narrowed down to a single model we used in the environment.
- Data Collection & Processing: Subject outreach proved to be difficult, as well as processing the data generated by subjects participating in the experiment.
- Equipment Malfunctions: The Valve Index controller trigger occassionally ceased to function, causing a delay with some results.

# Conclusion
Overall, we're quite proud of what we have accomplished! Our Unity prototype was completed in an impressively short amount of time, and subjects showed positive reception to its design and execution. Many struggles were overcome, many long weeks were endured, but ultimately we have produced a result that satisfies what we set out to do initially.
